# SQL-QUERIES-ON-LOAN-DATA
In this project we will be practicing inserting and querying data using SQL. 
From the tablesdata.sql I created three tables namely client,loan and vehicle.Each of the tables had different variables that would be used to practise some queries.There questions that would guide us to write the queries.If you see a problem,please fork ,make the necessary changes,and create a pull request so that we can review the changes and merge them into the master repo and branch.
